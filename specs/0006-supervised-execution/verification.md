# Verification record

## Spec acceptance evidence — 2026-09-20

This slice authored spec 0006 (M5 — supervised agent execution,
self-hosting loop) to Accepted. Docs-only: the change adds
`specs/0006-supervised-execution/` (requirements.md, design.md,
tasks.md, verification.md, acceptance.md) and updates the
`docs/roadmap.md` M5 row. No changes under `src/`, `test/` or
`scripts/`.

Evidence:

- `git diff --check` — clean.
- `./scripts/check` (Temurin 17.0.20, Clojure 1.12.0): **214 tests,
  2154 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors** — exactly the 0005
  baseline; all 0001–0005 CLI gates pass unchanged. This is the
  inertness baseline: the spec PR changes no code and no test
  counts.
- Spec acceptance gates in `acceptance.md` are all checked for the
  spec slice; implementation acceptance gates are recorded as pending.
- No HomeKV-specific content: the only consumer mentions are the
  standard repository-boundary statements ("nothing HomeKV-specific,
  never here"), consistent with prior specs. All fixtures referenced
  are synthetic (`synth-*`).
- `docs/roadmap.md`: M5 row updated to "Accepted (0006):
  supervised agent execution — context projection, proposal
  protocol, fake + process agent adapters, isolated workers,
  capability dispatch, leases/fencing, action outbox, patch
  admission, post-action verification, separately-authorized PR
  publication, self-development policy promotion gates; automatic
  merge remains out of scope; implementation next". The 0006 scope
  is the design's M5 item list plus the two items earlier specs
  deferred to M5+ (the 0002 `leases`/`action_outbox` items and the
  0005 self-hosting policy promotion gates), so the row update is
  honest about that inclusion.

Claims: nothing is claimed Verified by this slice; no M5 milestone
acceptance is claimed. Spec status is Accepted (2026-09-20);
implementation (tasks T1–T8) is pending.
